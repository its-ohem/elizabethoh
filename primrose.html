<h1>"EVENING PRIMROSE"</h1>
<br>



<p>"Evening Primrose" was written for an Intro to Screenwriting class and is one of my first full-length creative works I produced in college. In fact, it was this class that encouraged me to declare a Creative Writing major. Writing in and studying the screenplay format was incredibly engaging -- it was as though I had discovered an entirely new medium for storytelling. "Evening Primrose" is my take on a queer rom-com: when a woman's car breaks down, she must seek refuge in an unlikely place with a woman-run family out in the Mojave Desert. It was fun to write and push myself out of my comfort zone by exploring new and unfamiliar genres.</p>
<p>After several workshopping sessions and consultations, I believed that "Evening Primrose" had a shot in the University of Cincinnati's English Department's Writing Prize Competition 2021. I submitted it to the Screenplay Prize category for screenplays shorter than ten pages, and a few weeks later I was awarded Best Screenplay. To have been awarded for a story in an entirely new medium of writing was beyond thrilling, and still I am very proud of my achievement.</p>
